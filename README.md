#### React Nanodegree Program
##### My Reads Project
-----
This is an ReactJS application to help you keep track of your books.
You have three shelfs:
* Currently Reading
* Want To Read
* Read

You can search on Google Books and add your favourite books.

This project demonstrates the understanding of
props, states, components, JSX, AJAX, and ES6/ES2015.

To load it in your local machine:

* Install node.js if you do not have it. It comes with npm(node package manager).
Make sure that you install node with the PATH variable so you can run node anywhere in your command prompt/terminal.
* Once node.js is installed, install the react package using this command: `npm install -g create-react-app`
* The environment is now ready. You can now clone this repo and cd into the folder.
* Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
* Now run `npm start` to start the app. If you have Yarn installed, you can run `yarn start`
* This will start the app in your default browser at: localhost:3000
